# markov_rust [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jcoates/markov_rust.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jcoates/markov_rust)
mini markov chain project created for senior seminar class

This was made as [part of a quick demo](http://slides.com/jcoates/markov#/).

I then wanted to update some piece of code to rust 1.0, and then wanted to test travis-ci, so I did both with this repo.
